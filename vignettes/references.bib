  abstract = {This paper summarizes a study undertaken to reveal potential challenges and opportunities for integrating optimization tools in net zero energy buildings (NZEB) design. The paper reviews current trends in simulation-based building performance optimization (BPO) and outlines major criteria for optimization tools selection and evaluation. This is based on analyzing user's needs for tools capabilities and requirement specifications. The review is carried out by means of a literature review of 165 publications and interviews with 28 optimization experts. The findings are based on an inter-group comparison between experts. The aim is to assess the gaps and needs for integrating BPO tools in NZEB design. The findings indicate a breakthrough in using evolutionary algorithms in solving highly constrained envelope, HVAC and renewable optimization problems. Simple genetic algorithm solved many design and operation problems and allowed measuring the improvement in the optimality of a solution against a base case. Evolutionary algorithms are also easily adapted to enable them to solve a particular optimization problem more effectively. However, existing limitations including model uncertainty, computation time, difficulty of use and steep learning curve. Some future directions anticipated or needed for improvement of current tools are presented.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {Buildings in cities consume 30\textendash 70\% of total primary energy, and improving building energy efficiency is one of the key strategies towards sustainable urbanization. Urban building energy models (UBEM) can support city managers to evaluate and prioritize energy conservation measures (ECMs) for investment and the design of incentive and rebate programs. This paper presents the retrofit analysis feature of City Building Energy Saver (CityBES) to automatically generate and simulate UBEM using EnergyPlus based on cities' building datasets and user-selected ECMs. CityBES is a new open web-based tool to support city-scale building energy efficiency strategic plans and programs. The technical details of using CityBES for UBEM generation and simulation are introduced, including the workflow, key assumptions, and major databases. Also presented is a case study that analyzes the potential retrofit energy use and energy cost savings of five individual ECMs and two measure packages for 940 office and retail buildings in six city districts in northeast San Francisco, United States. The results show that: (1) all five measures together can save 23\textendash 38\% of site energy per building; (2) replacing lighting with light-emitting diode lamps and adding air economizers to existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are most cost-effective with an average payback of 2.0 and 4.3years, respectively; and (3) it is not economical to upgrade HVAC systems or replace windows in San Francisco due to the city's mild climate and minimal cooling and heating loads. The CityBES retrofit analysis feature does not require users to have deep knowledge of building systems or technologies for the generation and simulation of building energy models, which helps overcome major technical barriers for city managers and their consultants to adopt UBEM.},

  abstract = {Bayesian calibration as proposed by Kennedy and O'Hagan [22] has been increasingly applied to building energy models due to its ability to account for the discrepancy between observed values and model predictions. However, its application has been limited to calibration using monthly aggregated data because it is computationally inefficient when the dataset is large. This study focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by: (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with Gelman\textendash Rubin statistics R\textasciicircum{} within 1{$\pm$}0.1. The coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CVRMSE) and normalized mean biased error (NMBE) were also within the thresholds set by ASHRAE Guideline 14 [1].},

The relational model is solidly based on two parts of mathematics: firstorder predicate logic and the theory of relations. This book, however, does not dwell on the theoretical foundations, but rather on all the features of the relational model that I now perceive as important for database users, and therefore for DBMS vendors. My perceptions result from 20 years of practical experience in computing and data processing (chiefly, but not exclusively, with large-scale customers of IBM), followed by another 20 years of research. I believe that this is the first book to deal exclusively with the relational approach. It does, however, include design principles in Chapters 21 and 22. It is also the first book on the relational model by the originator of that model. All the ideas in the relational model described in this book are mine, except in cases where I explicitly credit someone else. In developing the relational model, I have tried to follow Einstein's advice, "Make it as simple as possible, but no simpler." I believe that in the last clause he was discouraging the pursuit of simplicity to the extent of distorting reality. So why does the book contain 30 chapters and two appendixes? To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the history of research and development of the relational model.},

  abstract = {Buildings consume more than one-third of the world's primary energy. Reducing energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions in the buildings sector through energy conservation and efficiency improvements constitutes a key strategy for achieving global energy and environmental goals. Building performance simulation has been increasingly used as a tool for designing, operating and retrofitting buildings to save energy and utility costs. However, opportunities remain for researchers, software developers, practitioners and policymakers to maximize the value of building performance simulation in the design and operation of low energy buildings and communities that leverage interdisciplinary approaches to integrate humans, buildings, and the power grid at a large scale. This paper presents ten challenges that highlight some of the most important issues in building performance simulation, covering the full building life cycle and a wide range of modeling scales. The formulation and discussion of each challenge aims to provide insights into the state-of-the-art and future research opportunities for each topic, and to inspire new questions from young researchers in this field.},

  abstract = {Incorporating energy efficiency and sustainable green design features into new/existing buildings has become a top priority in recent years for building owners, designers, contractors, and facility managers. This paper intends to address why delivery of an energy efficient building is not just the result of applying one or more isolated technologies. Rather, it can best be obtained using an integrated whole building process throughout the entire project development process, which leads building designers to generate a large amount of data during energy simulations. The authors observed that even a simple energy modeling run generated pages of data with many different variables. The volumes of energy modeling data clearly overwhelm traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries with so many factors to be considered. An integrated or whole building design process involves studies of the energy-related impacts and interactions of all building components, including the building location, envelope (walls, windows, doors, and roof), heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, controls, and equipment, which shows why it is so difficult to find the correlation between different systems. The objective of this research is to develop an energy efficient building design process using data mining technology which can help project teams discover important patterns to improve the building design. This paper utilizes the data mining technology to extract interrelationships and patterns of interest from a large dataset. Case study revealed that data mining based energy modeling help project teams discover useful patterns to improve the energy efficiency of building design during the design phase. The method developed during this research could be used to guide designers and engineers through the process of completing an early design energy analysis based on energy simulation models.},

In this paper, a modular parametric optimization framework combining advanced building modelling, LCA, energy calculation and single- and multi-objective environmental optimization was developed and applied to a multi-apartment house in Hungary. The variables comprise geometry, envelope, fixtures, as well as the heating energy source. The objective is the life cycle environmental impact expressed in terms of the six most common LCA indicators. The results show that a relatively compact shape, large windows to south equipped with shading and very high levels of insulation are optimal from an environmental perspective. It was also proven that focusing only on the embodied or operational impact leads to a suboptimal solution, and the choice of the energy source for the operation of the building has a significant influence on the achievable optimum. Through the optimization, significant environmental savings of 60\textendash 80\% were achieved compared to the initial design options showing the potential for the application of such methods in architectural design.},

The goals of this paper are to estimate life-cycle energy savings, carbon emission reduction, and cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency measures in new commercial buildings using an integrated design approach, and estimate the implications from a cost on energy-based carbon emissions. A total of 576 energy simulations are run for 12 prototypical buildings in 16 cities, with 3 building designs for each building-location combination. Simulated energy consumption and building cost databases are used to determine the life-cycle cost-effectiveness and carbon emissions of each design. The results show conventional energy efficiency technologies can be used to decrease energy use in new commercial buildings by 20\textendash 30\% on average and up to over 40\% for some building types and locations. These reductions can often be done at negative life-cycle costs because the improved efficiencies allow the installation of smaller, cheaper HVAC equipment. These improvements not only save money and energy, but reduce a building's carbon footprint by 16\% on average. A cost on carbon emissions from energy use increases the return on energy efficiency investments because energy is more expensive, making some cost-ineffective projects economically feasible.},

  abstract = {The timely publication of scientific results is essential for dynamic advances in science. The ubiquitous availability of computers which are connected to a global network made the rapid and low-cost distribution of information through electronic channels possible. New concepts, such as Open Access publishing and preprint servers are currently changing the traditional print media business towards a community-driven peer production. However, the cost of scientific literature generation, which is either charged to readers, authors or sponsors, is still high. The main active participants in the authoring and evaluation of scientific manuscripts are volunteers, and the cost for online publishing infrastructure is close to negligible. A major time and cost factor is the formatting of manuscripts in the production stage. In this article we demonstrate the feasibility of writing scientific manuscripts in plain markdown (MD) text files, which can be easily converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using Pandoc. The simple syntax of Markdown assures the long-term readability of raw files and the development of software and workflows. We show the implementation of typical elements of scientific manuscripts\textemdash formulas, tables, code blocks and citations\textemdash and present tools for editing, collaborative writing and version control. We give an example on how to prepare a manuscript with distinct output formats, a DOCX file for submission to a journal, and a LATEX/PDF version for deposition as a PeerJ preprint. Further, we implemented new features for supporting `semantic web' applications, such as the `journal article tag suite'\textemdash JATS, and the `citation typing ontology'\textemdash CiTO standard. Reducing the work spent on manuscript formatting translates directly to time and cost savings for writers, publishers, readers and sponsors. Therefore, the adoption of the MD format contributes to the agile production of open science literature. Pandoc Scholar is freely available from https://github.com/pandoc-scholar.},

The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

  abstract = {The building design community is challenged by continuously increasing energy demands, which are often combined with ambitious goals for indoor environment, for environmental impact, and for building costs. To aid decision-making, building simulation is widely used in the late design stages, but its application is still limited in the early stages in which design decisions have a major impact on final building performance and costs. The early integration of simulation software faces several challenges, which include time-consuming modeling, rapid change of the design, conflicting requirements, input uncertainties, and large design variability. In addition, building design is a multi-collaborator discipline, where design decisions are influenced by architects, engineers, contractors, and building owners. This review covers developments in both academia and in commercial software industry that target these challenges. Identified research areas include statistical methods, optimisation, proactive simulations, knowledge based input generation, and interoperability between CAD-software and building performance software. Based on promising developments in literature, we propose a simulation framework that facilitates proactive, intelligent, and experience based building simulation which aid decision making in early design. To find software candidates accommodating this framework, we compare existing software with regard to intended usage, interoperability, complexity, objectives, and ability to perform various parametric simulations.},

Because of this pressure, managers of these programs are looking for ways to lower the cost of energy analysis and increase the performance of the buildings being designed. The energy consultants that perform this analysis typically use a workflow in which they define a baseline energy model, run a number of alternative design scenarios, and use the results to recommend a particular set of energy conservation measures (ECMs) for a project. Such a workflow is possible using the first version of the OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT), which additionally leverages the flexibility of OpenStudio Measures and the Building Component Library (BCL) to enable user-customizable, sharable parametric descriptions of ECMs. PAT is a flexible, freely available tool, which can be used for many types of building energy simulation projects. In this paper we will focus on the use of PAT as part of the Xcel Energy Design Assistance Program and explain the particular features that were built-in to support that use case, including utility-approved measures and energy model input data, utilityspecific Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QAQC) checks, automated reporting, and access to cloud computing. Xcel has found that using PAT helps its EDA program remain viable by making energy modeling cheaper while finding equal or deeper savings without sacrificing quality.},

  abstract = {Recent research on identification of user barriers for the adoption of building performance simulation (BPS) tools indicates that architects wants to use the output from BPS to inform their decisions in the early design stage, but only if the BPS tools are conformed to fit their design practice. In this paper we therefore propose a research framework for the development of BPS tools conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage. The proposed framework was constructed based on review of existing research methodologies in the area of BPS for informing decisions in the early design stage, and on review of methodologies used in other research fields, such as design research, social science, software development, and innovation research. The proposed research framework consists of four elements: 1) a reflective researcher who navigates the research activities and reflect on research methods, approaches and outcome; 2) a framing of the research to identify relevant theme, topic and research question of interest; 3) an iterative workflow procedure of planning, acting, observing and reflecting to generate a spiral of understanding, inspired by action research; and 4) a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods and approaches from the related research fields that could be applied continuously to seek and refine different solutions. The paper also reports on an application example which demonstrated that the framework is a helpful tool for systematic navigation and documentation of research activities and collection of data. Furthermore, the iterative nature of the framework continuously increases the researchers understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the design practice in early design stage enabling them to make better proposals for BPS tools that are conformed to fit common design practice in the early design stage.},

In building energy modeling, scripting has emerged as a powerful tool for automating both standard tasks such as generating a code-minimum baseline model from a model of a proposed or actual building and for workflow customization. This paper presents four scripting frameworks for EnergyPlus. Eppy makes EnergyPlus input objects accessible as Python objects, allowing them to be manipulated programmatically. Modelkit is an embedded Ruby library that allows modelers to create parameterized templates that instantiate different specific EnergyPlus input files depending on parameter values. OpenStudio Measures provide programmatic access to the OpenStudio object model; that model is translated into an EnergyPlus input file. CBECC uses a custom scripting/rule engine that operates on the Standards Data Dictionary (SDD) building model schema; OpenStudio is used to translate SDD files to EnergyPlus input files. The paper discusses the philosophy behind each system, its architecture and core capabilities, and uses simple modeling tasks to show how each system is used in practice.},

However, Ladybug offers several advantages that are currently not offered by existing Rhino/Grasshopper related environmental design plugins. Ladybug imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design. It also simplifies the process of analysis, automates and expedites the calculations, and provides easy to understand graphical visualizations in the 3D modeling interface of Rhino/Grasshopper. It also allows users to work with validated energy and daylighting engines such as EnergyPlus, Radiance and Daysim. Integration with the parametric tools of grasshopper allows for almost instantaneous feedback on design modifications, and as it runs within the design environment, the information and analysis is interactive. The development is a free and open source; users can customize the tool based on their needs and contribute to the source code.},

In response to this need, two key tools have emerged to help engineers, building scientists and energy managers understand building energy usage and derive energy-efficiency solutions: data analytics and simulation. While both data analytics and simulation hold significant promise, we lack a clear understanding on the use, barriers and expectations of both in the building energy management decision-making process. This study conducts a nationwide survey of 448 building energy management professionals in the United States to help elucidate: 1) what impacts the adoption of data analytics and simulation among building energy management professionals; 2) in what phases of the building energy management decision-making process are data analytics and simulation currently used; and 3) what are the barriers of use for data analytics and simulation and how can they be improved to better support building energy management decision-making. Overall, results indicate that professional domain plays a large role in associating the uses, barriers and expectations for data analytics and simulation. Results also indicate that data analytics and simulation could be coupled to leverage functionality as they are used in similar phases of the decision-making process. Lastly, results point to opportunities for improving the applicability of data analytics and simulation tools as well as training for both. In the end, this study aims to provide a quantitative basis for improving the efficacy and integration of data analytics and simulation in the building energy management domain.},

Therefore, this paper is to investigate the development process of ASF grounded on parametric design tools with a focus towards its visual comfort indices through a controllable shading system. To that end, first, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to develop an origami-based dynamic system, and three numerical timing patterns were then applied using Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino. In addition, the environmental plug-ins of Honeybee and Ladybug were employed to determine indoor daylight quality via different geometrical and physical properties. Thus, 1800 design models were prepared, based on several variables including rotation motions, indoor view angles, time hours and transmittance properties in order to investigate the daylighting performance and glare probability in a single office space located in the hot-arid climate representative; Tehran, Iran. Furthermore, interactive correlations between the geometrical pattern and visual performance were investigated, leading to this fact that the proposed prototype can significantly improve the flexibility of the shading system to control visual comfort. As the conclusion, all datasets were integrated into an algorithmic workflow while converting its advantages and limitations into an optimization process. Finally, a full potential hexagonal adaptive system was presented to achieve the maximum visual comfort level based on the users' preferences that can be the basis for future investment on smart building envelopes.},

However, there has been little research on how to determine informative energy data in Bayesian calibration in building energy models. Therefore, this study aims to determine and choose informative energy data using correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering method. A case study of retail building is used to demonstrate the proposed methods to infer four unknown input parameters using EnergyPlus program. The results indicate that the different combinations of energy data can provide various levels of accuracy in estimating unknown input variables in model calibration. This suggests that Bayesian computation is suitable for inferring the parameters when there are missing energy data that can be treated as uninformative output data. The proposed method can be also used to find the redundant information on energy data in order to improve computational efficiency in Bayesian calibration.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment has become an active research field because a number of factors influencing energy use in buildings are inherently uncertain. This paper provides a systematic review on the latest research progress of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment from four perspectives: uncertainty data sources, forward and inverse methods, application of uncertainty analysis, and available software. First, this paper describes the data sources of uncertainty in building performance analysis to provide a firm foundation for specifying variations of uncertainty factors affecting building energy. The next two sections focus on the forward and inverse methods. Forward uncertainty analysis propagates input uncertainty through building energy models to obtain variations of energy use, whereas inverse uncertainty analysis infers unknown input factors through building energy models based on energy data and prior information. For forward analysis, three types of approaches (Monte Carlo, non-sampling, and non-probabilistic) are discussed to provide sufficient choices of uncertainty methods depending on the purpose and specific application of a building project. For inverse analysis, recent research has concentrated more on Bayesian computation because Bayesian inverse methods can make full use of prior information on unknown variables. Fourth, several applications of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment are discussed, including building stock analysis, HVAC system sizing, variations of sensitivity indicators, and optimization under uncertainty. Moreover, the software for uncertainty analysis is described to provide flexible computational environments for implementing uncertainty methods described in this review. This paper concludes with the trends and recommendations for further research to provide more convenient and robust uncertainty analysis of building energy. Uncertainty analysis has been ready to become the mainstream approach in building energy assessment although a number of issues still need to be addressed.},

The review results demonstrate that the data-driven approaches have well addressed a large variety of building energy related applications, such as load forecasting and prediction, energy pattern profiling, regional energy-consumption mapping, benchmarking for building stocks, global retrofit strategies and guideline making etc. Significantly, this review refines a few key tasks for modification of the data-driven approaches in the context of application to building energy analysis. The conclusions drawn in this review could facilitate future micro-scale changes of energy use for a particular building through the appropriate retrofit and the inclusion of renewable energy technologies. It also paves an avenue to explore potential in macro-scale energy-reduction with consideration of customer demands.

In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.

  abstract = {Energy simulation, the virtual representation and reproduction of energy processes for an entire building or a specific space, could assist building professionals with identifying relatively optimal energy conservation measures (ECMs). A review of current work revealed that methods for achieving simultaneous high accuracies in different levels of simulations, such as building level and zone level, have not been systematically explored, especially when there are several zones and multiple HVAC units in a building. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel framework that can calibrate a model with high accuracies at multiple levels. In order to evaluate the performance of the calibration framework, we simulated HVAC-related energy consumption at the building level, at the ECM level and at the zone level. The simulation results were compared with the measured HVAC-related energy consumption. Our findings showed that MBE and CV (RMSE) were below 8.5\% and 13.5\%, respectively, for all three levels of energy simulation, demonstrating that the proposed framework could accurately simulate the building energy process at multiple levels. In addition, in order to estimate the potential energy efficiency improvements when different ECMs are implemented, the model has to be robust to the changes resulting from the building being operated under different control strategies. Mixed energy ground truths from two ECMs were used to calibrate the energy model. The results demonstrated that the model performed consistently well for both ECMs. Specific contributions of the study presented in this paper are the introduction of a novel calibration framework for multi-level simulation calibration, and improvements to the robustness of the calibrated model for different ECMs.},

  abstract = {Parameter identifiability is the concept of whether uncertain parameters can be correctly estimated from the observed data. The main cause of parameter unidentifiability in Bayesian inference is known as `overparameterization'. In this study, the likelihood confidence interval (CI) and the likelihood confidence region (CR) were introduced for quantifying the parameter identifiability. The likelihood CI and CR can be regarded as the parameter range (one-dimensional) and parameter space (two-dimensional or higher) that can identify parameter values, respectively. For this purpose, an EnergyPlus reference office building provided by the US DOE was used in this study. Four estimation parameters in the EnergyPlus model were analyzed using the likelihood CI and CR. It was found that the closer the likelihood CI of a parameter is to the prior's parameter range, the more unidentifiable the parameter. In addition, a biplot analysis was conducted to examine a correlation between two parameters. The more correlated a parameter is with others, the more unidentifiable the parameter. It is suggested that the visual assessment of likelihood CIs and CRs can help in investigating whether Bayesian inference results can be accurately obtained.},

  abstract = {An objective measure of building energy performance is crucial for performance assessment and rational decision making on energy retrofits and policies of existing buildings. One of the most popular measures of building energy performance benchmarking is Energy Use Intensity (EUI, kwh/m2). While EUI is simple to understand, it only represents the amount of consumed energy per unit floor area rather than the real performance of a building. In other words, it cannot take into account building services such as operation hours, comfortable environment, etc. EUI is often misinterpreted by assuming that a lower EUI for a building implies better energy performance, which may not actually be the case if many of the building services are not considered. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper presents Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) coupled with Monte Carlo sampling. DEA is a data-driven and non-parametric performance measurement method. DEA can quantify the performance of a given building given multiple inputs and multiple outputs. In this study, two existing office buildings were selected. For energy performance benchmarking, 1000 virtual peer buildings were generated from a Monte Carlo sampling and then simulated using EnergyPlus. Based on a comparison between DEA-based and EUI-based benchmarking, it is shown that DEA is more performance-oriented, objective, and rational since DEA can take into account input (energy used to provide the services used in a building) and output (level of services provided by a building). It is shown that DEA can be an objective building energy benchmarking method, and can be used to identify low energy performance buildings.},

  abstract = {Parametric study is a useful method for exploring alternative design options and establishing dependencies between design variables. The development of an open-source research tool, jEPlus, has been reported in 2009. The tool is designed to assist setting up parametric runs with EnergyPlus models, and to perform the simulations in ``parallel'' mode. This paper uses an example to demonstrate how jEPlus can be used for setting up complex parametric runs. In the example, four different building types and five HVAC system configurations were considered along with design parameters including insulation, glazing, temperature set points and day lighting control options. Further more, the simulations were carried out in three different climatic regions. Given that the total number of simulations exceeds 30,000, it would have been a tedious, if not impossible, job to set them up manually. jEPlus made it trivial, however, by automating the tasks such as generating input files for EnergyPlus, executing simulations, and extracting results.},
